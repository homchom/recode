### Changes

- Significantly improved performance
- Side chat is now centered
- Message stacking now uses Minecraft's chat status system
(indicated by a hoverable aqua line to the left of the message)
- The DiamondFire button of the title screen now supports the High Contrast resource pack

### Fixes

- Fixed many features not working for non-ranked players
- Viewing the profile of a non-ranked player no longer errors
- General performance no longer slows over time (thanks Wyzzard225)
- The mod is now compatible with Sodium 0.5 (but is __no longer compatible__ with 0.4, so players must update)
- Fixed the 'Pick Block' vanilla key bind not working with the mod
- Auto /chat local now works when joining a plot from another plot
- Side chat now rescales with the game window
- Chat status descriptions can now be viewed for messages in side chat

### Removals
- Temporarily disabled `/nbssearch`, mainly for security reasons (re-adding this is a high priority!)
