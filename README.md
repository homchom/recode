## Features

DiamondFire is a Minecraft server where you can create your own minigames with code. recode seeks to improve the DF experience beyond the limitations of a server plugin. All features in the mod are toggleable to provide everyone with the modular experience they prefer most.

- Utility commands to supercharge your code, such as importing Note Block Studio files as Code Templates
- Automation of frequently used commands, such as `/resetcompact` and `/chat local`
- DiamondFire-specific keybinds
- The ability to hide messages you don't want
- Additional HUDs, such as the LagSlayer HUD to keep your action bar free
- An additional Sided Chat to partition your messages
- And much more!
